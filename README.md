# Titanic_Predictions
Predicted a binary outcome, either survived at the titanic or not, according to different features

The titanic is one of the most iconic and at the same time sad stories in the history of human beings. There are barely individuals who are not familiar with its story and how lucky some people where on that liner, because of certain charcteristics that they took with them. Wether they where kids or had a higher purchasing power, there was a pattern to follow when predicting the probability of getting a save boat, leaving unharmed the ship.
